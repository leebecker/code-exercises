Case: The nurse is caring for a $28$-year-old client who is $gravida 4$, $para 2$, is at $40 weeks gestation$ and is in active labor. The client is receiving $titrated intravenous oxytocin$ for augmentation of labor via the secondary line on an intravenous pump. The client is also receiving maintenance $intravenous fluid$ of lactated $Ringer's solution$ at $125 mL/hr$ via an intravenous pump. The client has a cervical dilatation of $5 cm$ and a cervical effacement of $100%$ with a fetal station of 0 in vertex presentation. Intact amniotic membranes are noted. Category I tracing of fetal heart rate (FHR) of $150$bpm, with moderate variability, and $3 accelerations of 15$bpm over the baseline lasting 15 seconds via external ultrasound. The client is experiencing $contractions every 5 minutes$, which are lasting $70 seconds$ with $moderate intensity$ via tocotransducer. Vital Signs: HR$88$, BP$115/78$, RR$15$, T$100.4$F. Has a continuous $epidural infusion$ of $0.25% bupivacaine$ with $fentanyl$ running at $10 mL/hr$. Pain $0/10$ at this time. Client states, 'I had postpartum hemorrhage with my last vaginal delivery and I required a blood transfusion.' Medical history of $hypothyroidism$ and $asthma$. The nurse decides to perform $intrauterine resuscitation$.
Question: Select the potential steps the nurse should take to perform intrauterine resuscitation?
- Place the client in the left lateral position.
- Increase the infusion of titrated intravenous oxytocin.
- Administer 10 L of oxygen via nonrebreather mask.
- Request that the obstetrician artificially rupture the client's membranes.
- Check the client's cervix for changes in dilatation.

Vital signs: $101.1$F, P$92$, RR$22$, BP$152/86$, pulse oximetry reading $94% on oxygen$ at $2$L/min via nasal cannula. Upon assessment, the client's breathing appears $slightly labored$, and course crackles are noted in bilateral lung bases. Skin $slightly cool$ to touch and $pale pink$ in tone, pulse $+3$ and $irregular$. Capillary refill is $3 seconds$. Client is $alert$ and oriented to person, place, and time. The client's daughter states, 'Sometimes it seems like my mother is confused.'
Question: Select which of the following findings are a sign of worsening conditions?
- Lung sounds
- Capillary refill
- Client orientation
- Radial pulse characteristics
- Characteristics of the cough
